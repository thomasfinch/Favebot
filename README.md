Favebot
=======

Favebot allows you to natively view the list of people who favorited a tweet in Tweetbot 3 instead of being kicked out to Favstar. If you want to compile the code yourself you'll need to #define the OAuth consumer key and secret from the official Twitter iPhone app in Credentials.h (I didn't want to make them public for obvious reasons).
