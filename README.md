Favebot
=======

Favebot allows you to natively view the list of people who favorited a tweet in Tweetbot 3 instead of being kicked out to Favstar. It's currently kind of hacky and you'll need to #define your own credentials in Credentials.h, including the official Twitter iPhone app OAuth key and secret as well as your Twitter username and password.
