Favebot
=======

Favebot allows you to natively view the list of people who favorited a tweet in Tweetbot 3 instead of being kicked out to Favstar. It's currently kind of hacky and you'll need to #define your own credentials in Credentials.h, including an app OAuth key and secret as well as a Twitter username and password.
